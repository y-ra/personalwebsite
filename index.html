            <h3>Hello, I'm Rae.</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/y-ra">GitHub</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://y-ra.itch.io/" target="_blank">Itch.io</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Hey, nice to meet you! I go by Rae or Rachel (either one works, truly), and I am an Honors Dean's List
              student at Northeastern
              majoring in Combined Computer Science & Music with a Concentration in Music Technology. <br><br>

              Fun fact: I have perfect pitch! (Though absolute pitch is the more scientifically correct term.)<br><br>

              One of the primary reasons I chose this path is for the intersections between art and technology,
              particularly for video games. I figured that video games need programming & they need music; what better
              major to pursue? I'm also focused on the overall creative applications of programming and software in
              general,
              outside of gaming.<br><br>

              There are a couple of initial factors that have led me to being where I am now. First, all the way
              back in middle school, I realized that computer science had creative power, power that could
              send very strong messages. 14-yr old me was making simple JavaScript Choose-Your-Path
              games using browser pop-ups, to try to send a message about fighting animal abuse, an issue I cared and still care
              deeply about. 
              Second, some of my earliest memories I can recall revolve around video games. I remember
              sitting in our old house's dusty basement and watching my dad strike the final blow into
              Ganondorf's chest in Twilight Princess. I remember my sisters and I waking up early in the
              morning just to play Minecraft together. I remember always being on this spelling and typing
              game (can't recall the name now) that I could not stop playing, ending up with me now with
              my accidental peak typing speed of 140 WPM. Third, the only times in my childhood when I
              felt like I was flying were when I was either listening to any Legend of Zelda OST or playing
              it on the piano. In the present day, my listening repertoire has extended to so many other game
              soundtracks as well.<br><br>

              I'm currently working
              on a breakcore track for an NU alumni's upcoming indie video game, so stay tuned for that. And, feel free
              to
              ask me anytime about the Undertale, Tears of the Kingdom, or Ocarina of Time soundtracks, if you want to
              hear me talk for a really long time. <br><br>

              Right now, I'm a Production Studios Assistant for Northeastern Media Studios, and a Senior Developer for
              Scout Northeastern. As a Production Studios Assistant, I operate and maintain broadcast and recording
              equipment across a full-scale production facility, and I audio-engineer and provide technical support for
              client sessions by
              troubleshooting issues across interfaces, including Solid State Logic (SSL) consoles and Pro Tools
              systems.
              As a Senior Developer, I've built a new website for The Student Kitchen based on client specifications and
              design team prototypes, in addition to mentoring and upskilling 2 Junior Developers while implementing
              a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with a full testing suite. <br><br>

              Previously, I had the opportunity to intern at Black Soup GmbH in Berlin as a Software Engineering &
              Marketing Co-Op/Intern, where I gained hands-on experience in video game marketing, influencer outreach,
              media planning, and campaign execution. I led 4 organic marketing campaigns for video game titles (Lost
              Records: Bloom & Rage, Memoriapolis, Palia, Rooftops & Alleys), executing influencer outreach and digital
              strategy that collectively garnered over 5M impressions and 250K engagements across social platforms.
              Furthermore, I acted as a primary point of contact for clients (KRAFTON, Radical Theory, Riot Games,
              Singularity 6). A very fun part of the job involved managing and coordinating with content creators to
              facilitate content creation, and I directly contributed to driving over 1M combined views on
              campaign-related
              content. I also engineered Google Apps Scripts to automate media planning and reporting, and contributed
              to designing a centralized campaign database. One of my most favorite parts involved getting to know
              the incredible creators Vasily & Nat of the game
              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883370/PEPPERED_an_existential_platformer/">PEPPERED</a>.
              I got to proofread some of the script for the game,
              and seeing their love and drive for the project was truly inspiring. <br><br>

              In the near future, I'd love to get more hands-on experience and exposure with specifically video game
              programming. <br><br>

              I'm also delving deeper into my interest in building practical, user-centric software and taking full
              ownership of projects from concept through deployment. Developing web applications or software tools that
              enable people to improve their lives or their impact on the planet is something that got me into computer
              science initially. You can see an example of this in my Garment Genie browser extension, NUCircle, and
              more,
              found on this website's portfolio page. <br><br>

              Thanks for visiting my website. Feel free to reach out to hear about my projects, experiences, personal
              take on the ever-so-complicated Legend of Zelda timeline, or to test my perfect pitch capacity. Let me
              know if you find the hidden treasure on this site! (Though it's inaccessible on mobile devices.)
